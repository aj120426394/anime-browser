**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Completion Date**: October 24, 2025  
**Deployment URL**: https://leonardo-web-challenge.vercel.app/  

---

## Overview

T135 is now **fully implemented and ready for execution**. The task implements a comprehensive end-to-end testing framework for validating the production Vercel deployment.

## What Has Been Delivered

### 1. ✅ Updated Playwright Configuration

**File**: `playwright.config.ts`

**Features**:

- Conditional web server (disabled for production URLs)
- Extended timeouts for production network conditions (30s base, 10s expect)
- Full support for 5 browser/device combinations

**Key Code**:
```typescript
const baseURL = process.env.PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL || "http://localhost:3000";
const isProduction = baseURL.includes("vercel.app");

webServer: isProduction ? undefined : { command: "npm run dev", ... }
```

## How to Execute T135

### Prerequisites
1. ✅ T133 complete: Environment variables set in Vercel dashboard
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CHALLENGE_VERSION=3.5`
2. ✅ T134 complete: Application deployed to Vercel
   - URL: https://leonardo-web-challenge.vercel.app/

### Run the Full E2E Test Suite

```bash
# 1. Navigate to project root
cd /Users/jafo/Git/leonardo-web-challenge

# 2. Set the deployment URL
export PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=https://leonardo-web-challenge.vercel.app

# 3. Run full test suite (all browsers)
npm run test:e2e

# Expected: 50+ tests pass in < 10 minutes
```

### Run Specific Configurations

```bash
# Desktop browsers only
npm run test:e2e -- --project=chromium
npm run test:e2e -- --project=firefox
npm run test:e2e -- --project=webkit

# Mobile browsers
npm run test:e2e -- --project="Mobile Chrome"
npm run test:e2e -- --project="Mobile Safari"

# Single test file
npm run test:e2e -- e2e/profile-gate.spec.ts
npm run test:e2e -- e2e/pagination.spec.ts
npm run test:e2e -- e2e/modal-interaction.spec.ts

# Debug mode (shows browser UI)
npm run test:e2e -- --headed --debug

# With HTML report
npm run test:e2e -- --reporter=html
npx playwright show-report
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Immediate (This Week)
```bash
# Run the E2E tests
export PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=https://leonardo-web-challenge.vercel.app
npm run test:e2e

# View the HTML report
npx playwright show-report
```

### 2. Short-term (This Month)
- Set up continuous testing via GitHub Actions or similar
- Monitor Vercel Analytics for production issues
- Track user feedback and error rates

### 3. Long-term (Ongoing)
- Re-run E2E tests weekly
- Update tests as features evolve
- Monitor Lighthouse scores
- Optimize performance based on real usage data

---

## Troubleshooting

### Tests timeout
```bash
# Check if site is accessible
curl -I https://leonardo-web-challenge.vercel.app

# Run with extended timeout
npm run test:e2e -- --timeout=60000
```

### Profile form not found
```bash
# Run in headed mode to see what's happening
npm run test:e2e -- --headed --debug

# Check browser console for errors
```

### Images not loading
- Expected in headless mode
- Verify in headed mode with `--headed` flag
- Check Vercel deployment logs

### Modal tests fail
- Ensure profile was saved in previous tests
- Run with `--headed` to see browser state
- Try specific test: `npm run test:e2e -- e2e/modal-interaction.spec.ts`
