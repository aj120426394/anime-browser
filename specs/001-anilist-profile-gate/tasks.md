# Tasks: AniList Profile Gate & Information Browser

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-anilist-profile-gate/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Testing is MANDATORY per constitution. All features must include unit tests (Vitest + RTL) and E2E tests (Playwright) for critical user journeys.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- Web app structure: `app/`, `components/`, `lib/`, `tests/`, `e2e/` at repository root
- Configuration files at repository root

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-9)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed) or sequentially in priority order
- **Polish (Phase 10)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories (assumes profile exists)
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Depends on User Story 2 (extends pagination) - Integration point
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Depends on User Story 2 (extends media display) - Integration point
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses same profile utilities as US1
- **User Story 6 (P2)**: Cross-cutting validation phase - Depends on all previous stories being implemented
- **User Story 7 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent footer implementation

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Utilities/hooks before components
- Components in dependency order (child components before parent containers)
- Pages last (consume components and hooks)
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes:
  - US1, US2, US5, US7 can start in parallel (independent)
  - US3 starts after US2 complete
  - US4 starts after US2 complete
  - US6 starts after all functional stories complete
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Components within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Polish tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 2

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 2 together:
Task T046: "Unit test for useMediaPage hook"
Task T047: "Unit test for MediaItem transformation"
Task T048: "Component test for MediaGrid"
Task T049: "Component test for MediaCard"
Task T050: "Component test for Pagination"
Task T051: "E2E test for data loading"
Task T052: "E2E test for pagination navigation"

# After tests fail, launch all independent components together:
Task T053: "Create MediaCard component"
Task T054: "Create MediaGrid component"
Task T055: "Create Pagination component"
```

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Testing is mandatory per project constitution
- All code must pass TypeScript strict mode
- All external inputs must be validated with Zod
- All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible (WCAG AA)
- TTI < 1s performance target must be met
