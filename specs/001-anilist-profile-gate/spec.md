# Feature Specification: AniList Profile Gate & Information Browser

**Feature Branch**: `001-anilist-profile-gate`
**Created**: 2025-10-24
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Goal: Gate access until user provides profile (username, job title). Then show paginated AniList data with images on an Information Page, deep-linkable via ?page=, with item modals. Footer shows challenge version. Deploy on Vercel."

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Profile Gate Blocks Access (Priority: P1)

As a first-time visitor without a saved profile, I must be prevented from viewing the information page until I provide my username and job title.

**Why this priority**: This is the core gating mechanism that demonstrates profile collection and access control. Without this, there's no gate functionality at all.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by visiting the site in a clean browser session. The profile form should appear and block access to the information page until valid data is submitted.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** no profile exists in local storage, **When** I visit the root URL (/), **Then** I see a profile form requesting username and job title
2. **Given** no profile exists in local storage, **When** I try to navigate directly to /information, **Then** I am redirected to the profile form
3. **Given** I am viewing the profile form, **When** I submit valid username and job title, **Then** my profile is saved and I can access the information page
4. **Given** I am viewing the profile form, **When** I try to submit with empty fields, **Then** I see validation errors and remain blocked

---

### User Story 2 - View Paginated AniList Data (Priority: P1)

As a user with a saved profile, I can view paginated lists of anime/manga data with images on the information page, and navigate between pages using pagination controls.

**Why this priority**: This is the primary content feature. Once unblocked, users need to see meaningful data from AniList.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a profile (or manually adding it to localStorage) and visiting /information. Page should display anime/manga items with images and working pagination controls.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have a saved profile, **When** I navigate to /information, **Then** I see the first page of anime/manga items with images
2. **Given** I am viewing page 1 of results, **When** I click "Next" or page 2, **Then** I see the second page of results
3. **Given** I am viewing page 3, **When** I click "Previous" or page 2, **Then** I see page 2 of results
4. **Given** I am on any page, **When** I scroll down, **Then** all images load properly and display anime/manga artwork
5. **Given** I am viewing any page of results, **When** the page loads, **Then** I see pagination controls showing current page and total pages

---

### User Story 3 - Deep-Linkable Pages (Priority: P1)

As a user, I can share or bookmark direct links to specific pages of results using the ?page=N query parameter, and the application loads that specific page when I visit the URL.

**Why this priority**: Deep linking is essential for shareable content and demonstrates proper URL parameter handling in the routing system.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening /information?page=5 in a new browser tab. If profile exists, page 5 should load directly. If no profile exists, should gate first then show page 5 after profile submission.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have a saved profile, **When** I navigate to /information?page=5, **Then** I see page 5 of results immediately
2. **Given** I have no saved profile, **When** I navigate to /information?page=5, **Then** I see the profile form, and after submission I am taken to page 5
3. **Given** I am viewing any page, **When** I navigate to another page, **Then** the URL updates to reflect the current page number (e.g., ?page=3)
4. **Given** I navigate to /information?page=999 (beyond available pages), **Then** I see the last available page or a friendly message

---

### User Story 4 - View Item Details in Modal (Priority: P2)

As a user viewing the information page, I can click on any anime/manga item to see detailed information in a modal dialog without leaving the current page.

**Why this priority**: Provides enhanced user experience and detailed information without disrupting pagination state. Secondary to core listing functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by loading /information, clicking any item, and verifying a modal opens with detailed information. Closing modal should return to same page state.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am viewing any page of results, **When** I click on an item, **Then** a modal opens displaying detailed information about that item
2. **Given** a modal is open, **When** I click the close button or outside the modal, **Then** the modal closes and I return to the same page I was viewing
3. **Given** a modal is open, **When** I press the Escape key, **Then** the modal closes
4. **Given** a modal is open, **When** I press Tab, **Then** focus cycles through focusable elements within the modal (accessibility requirement)

---

### User Story 5 - Profile Management (Priority: P2)

As a user with a saved profile, I can view, edit, and update my profile information (username and job title) at any time.

**Why this priority**: Allows users to correct or update their information. Secondary to initial profile capture and content viewing.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a profile, then accessing a profile edit interface, changing values, and verifying the changes persist across page reloads.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have a saved profile, **When** I navigate to the profile edit interface, **Then** I see my current username and job title pre-filled in a form
2. **Given** I am editing my profile, **When** I change my username and save, **Then** the new username is persisted to local storage
3. **Given** I am editing my profile, **When** I change my job title and save, **Then** the new job title is persisted to local storage
4. **Given** I am viewing my profile, **When** I want to edit it, **Then** I can easily find and access the edit functionality (e.g., via navigation, button, or settings)

---

### User Story 6 - Mobile-Friendly Experience (Priority: P2)

As a user on a mobile device, I can comfortably use all features of the application including viewing the profile form, browsing paginated results, and viewing item details.

**Why this priority**: Mobile accessibility is critical for modern web applications. Affects all user stories but can be validated as a separate concern.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening the application on a mobile device or using browser dev tools mobile emulation. All interactions should be touch-friendly and content should be readable without zooming.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on a mobile device, **When** I view the profile form, **Then** all fields are easily tappable and the form is fully visible without horizontal scrolling
2. **Given** I am on a mobile device, **When** I view the information page, **Then** items are displayed in a mobile-friendly layout (single column or appropriate grid)
3. **Given** I am on a mobile device, **When** I tap an item, **Then** the modal opens and is fully visible without requiring scrolling to see controls
4. **Given** I am on a mobile device, **When** I use pagination controls, **Then** buttons are large enough to tap easily and page changes are smooth

---

### User Story 7 - Challenge Version Footer (Priority: P3)

As a reviewer or stakeholder, I can see the challenge version number displayed in the footer on all pages to track which version of the application is deployed.

**Why this priority**: Important for versioning and tracking, but doesn't affect core user functionality. Nice-to-have for deployment tracking.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by viewing any page and verifying the footer displays the version number consistently.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on any page, **When** I scroll to the bottom, **Then** I see a footer displaying the challenge version number
2. **Given** I am viewing the footer, **When** I look at the version format, **Then** it clearly indicates the version (e.g., "v1.0.0" or "Challenge Version: 1.0.0")
3. **Given** I navigate between pages, **When** I check the footer, **Then** the version number is consistent across all pages

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the AniList API is unavailable or returns an error?
- What happens when a user tries to access a negative page number (e.g., ?page=-1)?
- What happens when a user enters extremely long username or job title values?
- What happens when localStorage is disabled or unavailable in the browser?
- What happens when the user navigates forward/backward using browser history buttons?
- What happens when images fail to load from AniList CDN?
- What happens when no results are returned from the API?
